                    <q>Physically, walking around to find something I can take. Wondering around to make sure I ain't being lied.
                    Something comes up to my mind what will my future be like?
                    Something drives my brain, another one sticks my heart. They both are fully different,
                    They start arguing.
                    <br>
                    I decide to carry on, my life is too short for arguing, I choose happiness.</q>

                        <p> <strong> Stay Motivated </strong>. 
                        This is the core above all, you have to REMEMBER your "WHY". Your "Why" is our purpose, we can call it a destination. Your "Why" is your reason. Your "Why" does not have to be grand, or large or catchy as long as it is <strong> AUTHENTHIC </strong>. </p>
                        <p> Well, sometimes when I get tired of my work, I forget what is my first purpose to start something. That's why we have Sticky Notes. </p>
                        <p> #tips, write down your sticky note and place it in front of you, directly to the place where you will always see. </p>

                        <p> Be Grateful. Creative person is the one who can do something on what they have. Guys, don't ever compare or contrast yourself with others. We all have our own circumstances and different story. Just learn and respect from others. Do not say he or she has that privileges. Remember this "One who wants to wear the crown, bears the crown". </p>
                        <p> #tips, be creative on what you have. Do something with what you've already had. Instead of buying or wanting new things. We gotta have our quality to adapt.</p>

                        <p> I always try to remember this quote, "Straight road doesn't make skillful drivers". Yes, there you go. It is okay to not be okay, that's normal. You think you have to be strong all the time. Why do we always feel the need to be strong? Why do we feel guilty when taking a time-out? I was overwhelmed with such guilt. How can I sit here and cry and feel sorry for myself, when I have some much to be grateful for? There’s so much work I need to get done,I don’t see anyone else making excuses for themselve. You think you’re not allowed to cry, to admit that you’re not okay. We're not gonna be in the good phase all the way, dude. Hard time is good too, remain balance. We learn from experience, whatever good or bad the situation is, remain calm.</p> 
                        <p>#tips, Have your own gratitude journal</p>

                        <h3> Learn To Rest, Not To Quit </h3>
                            <figure>
                                <img src= "assets/img/Have a break, not a quit.jpg" class="feature-img" alt= "Learn To Rest, Not To Quit">

                        <p> When we’re tired, frustrated, or impatient it’s easier to quit than it is to take a restorative rest. But that’s not how you drive success. Hard work requires energy, and important work requires time. Give yourself rest when you need it so you can stay the course through to completion, no matter how long it takes. Rest, don’t quit.</p>
                        <p>#tips, do your hobbies during the rest. Recharge and restore your energy. Have your coffee or tea, sleep, do exercise or cook. Anything you want to do. If me, I am going to reorganize stuffs because that could heal me. I watch Marie Kondo on Youtube and Netflix, it was so satisfying to organize our stuffs and throw unused stuffs. Keep the stuff that sparks joy.</p>

                        <p> I am a perfectionist. No one is perfect. Accept who you are and be the best version of yourself. During Hard times, there are a lot of trial and error, evaluate it. What you should change or improve. I learned this a long time ago. I am trying to not get emotional easily, Yes, I am struggling in controlling my emo and ego. I also learn time management and how to be discipline. Because, sometimes It is just nice to postpone things. But it ended up with regret, often. I also often feel overwhelmed, pressured and deppressed. But, well... we live and learn right. I got nervous easily, So, I found out that inhale and exhale are very important. It works well on me. So dude, try to inhale and exhale. </p>
                        <p>#tips, talk to yourself in the mirror. Recognize, understand, and know what you want in your life.</p>
